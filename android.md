# Android

## SDK

The Android SDK can be found on the [Android developers site](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). The only tools we really need are `fastboot` & `adb` though. It's best to get them from the official SDK for integrity purposes.

## ROMs

Best place to look for these is the [XDA developers forum](http://forum.xda-developers.com/).
