# Coding Style

## Indentation

While I used to program using tabs, I've shifted to using spaces now for portability. It allows for easier lining up of elements to improve readability too.

Another reason is because it's the regime set by the coding standard of my workspace (Plymouth Marine Laboratory at time of writing).

## Line length

I'm usually pretty elastic with line lengths. For example, the line lengths in this project far exceed the standard eighty characters. However, I do try & keep line lengths under a hundred characters. It's quite useful as a metre of how well designed your code is too, as if you're indenting so much that it's impractical to keep to that limit, you probably should be writing a separate function or something.
